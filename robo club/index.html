            What if you could build <span>ASIMOV or SOPHIA? </span> If you have ever aspired to build your own<span> robot</span>, then the <strong>Robotics Society of NIIT University, NUtronix </strong>is the place for you! We are a diverse group of students who find roots across various fields. Interested the work we do? <span>We build robots</span> to compete at both national and international events or just out of plain interest. We provide students with the resources to develop robots. <span>Robotics</span> is the branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, structural disposition, manufacture and application of robots. We strive to stimulate interest in robotics among the students of the institute. Besides making a serious endeavour to spread knowledge on Robotics and its diverse applications. <span>It was initiated in 2017 under the tutelage of <strong>Prof. Navin Kapur</strong> (Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering),</span> with the solitary objective of participating in the WRO.

            The club today is an active platform for students to display and develop their practical <span>machine building skills and knowledge</span>.  We are here to induct you into the rapidly expanding world of robotics. One on one guidance eagerly awaits you!

              The name Aspire One speaks for itself as their classes encourage us to believe and aspire for what we are hoping for, an entrance to IIT.
              Aspire one has taught me focus, determination, perseverance and hardwork is the only way to success. Nothing is impossible, not even the seemingly daunting task of gaining entrance into IIT.
              These classes have enhanced my learning passion and revealed my true potential. With the interactive classes during the weekends, numerous study sessions, extensive insider information and lots of extra practice
               on the Aspire book series, I am confident that I wouldn't have come close to achieving my dream of cracking IIT without Aspire One.
